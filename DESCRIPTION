Description: Uses existing parallelized system commands to read and write 
    compressed RDS files efficiently. The package's main functions override 
    `readRDS` and `writeRDS` from base to introduce parallellized versions using
    the existing system commands including `xz`, `lbzip2`, `pixz`, `pxz`, 
    `pbzip2`, `zstd`, and `pigz`. The functions search for the appropriate 
    compression software in the host system's path and if found, offload the 
    handling of compression and decompression taks to the external program. The 
    package must work on any Linux/Unix system, but not on Windows.
